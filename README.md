### React-Django-Project


Create a new folder on your computer to house the project and type: <br>
git clone https://github.com/KareemD123/React-Django-Project.git
<br>

You only have to clone it once. After you clone it, type: <br>

git checkout -b your_branch_name <br>

And then you can type code . or open vscode and start working <br>

(If code . doesnt work on your computer you can check out this link https://til.hashrocket.com/posts/zhpzaobirp-add-the-vscode-cli-to-your-path) <br>

After you complete your changes on VSCode, save and open your terminal in the project folder and type the following commands: <br>

Git status <br>
Git add . <br>
Git commit -m "your message" <br>
Git push your_branch_name master <br>
{login} (Let me know if it asks you for a token) <br>
Git checkout master <br>
Git delete -D your_branch_name <br>

The next time you begin coding start with this command (git pull) and then repeat the steps above: <br>

Git pull origin master <br>


Git checkout -b your_branch_name <br>
code . <br>
Git status .. .. .. .. ..
